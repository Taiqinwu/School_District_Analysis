# School District Analysis
* Analysize school district data to see each school's student performance in reading and math, and each school's budget.

## Overview of the school district analysis
Maria asked to help analying the school data. We will help Maria on student funding and students' standardized test scores. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will help school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. 

## Challenge Overview
After we completed the analysis for Maria. The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once youâ€™ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
